    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a self-taught and highly-motivated full-stack developer. After discovering my passion for programming in the summer of 2016, I have dedicated each day to increasing my knowledge and skill in the field of web development. My perfectionistic tendencies lend well toward efficient, DRY code and elegant page layouts. I strive to be the best at what I do, while working hand-in-hand with my peers to raise up the team as a whole.</p>
